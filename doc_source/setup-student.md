# Individual Student Setup for AWS Cloud9<a name="setup-student"></a>

This topic explains how to set up to use AWS Cloud9 as a student, with you as the only individual using your account with AWS\. To set up to use AWS Cloud9 for any other usage pattern, see [Getting Started with AWS Cloud9](get-started.md) for the correct instructions\. To learn about who qualifies as a student, see [Who can join AWS Educate](https://www.awseducate.com/faqs#fa0Po00000043dVcEAI) on the *AWS Educate Frequently Asked Questions* website\.

+  [Step 2: Sign In to the AWS Cloud9 Console](#setup-student-sign-in-ide) 
+  [Next Steps](#setup-student-next-steps) 

## Step 1: Create an Account with AWS<a name="setup-student-create-account"></a>

In this step, you create either an [AWS Educate Starter Account](#setup-student-create-account-starter) or a [regular AWS account](#setup-student-create-account-regular), which you can then use to access AWS Cloud9\.

For an AWS Educate Starter account, note the following:
+ You must be an eligible student\.
+ You don't need a credit card\.
+ There are some restrictions on AWS usage in the account\.
+ The account isn't eligible for the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)\.
+ After you graduate, you can no longer keep using the account\.
+ You can't link the account to any other account\.
+ You can't apply any additional AWS promotional credit to the account\.
+ AWS resources that you create in the account will stop working after all AWS promotional credit is used\.
+ If the account runs out of AWS promotional credit, the account is deactivated\.
+ You can't turn the account into a regular AWS account\.

For more information, see [What is the difference between the AWS Account and AWS Educate Starter Account](https://www.awseducate.com/faqs#fa0Po000000C0eH1EAJ) on the *AWS Educate Frequently Asked Questions* website\.

1. Skip ahead to [Step 2: Sign In to the AWS Cloud9 Console](#setup-student-sign-in-ide)\.

### Create a Regular AWS Account and Apply for AWS Educate<a name="setup-student-create-account-regular"></a>

If you already have a regular AWS account, skip ahead to step 6 in this procedure to apply for AWS Educate\.

1. Choose **Sign In to the Console**\.

1. After you complete the application process, AWS will send you an email with the title **Thank You for Applying for AWS Educate**\. This email includes details such as how to check the status of your application and how to contact AWS Educate support with any questions\.

   After AWS Educate approves your application, AWS will send you an email with the title **AWS Educate Application Approved**\. Note that the approval process might take a day or longer\. You can start using AWS Cloud9 without waiting for this approval\. To do this, skip ahead to [Step 2: Sign in to the AWS Cloud9 Console](#setup-student-sign-in-ide)\.

1. After you get the approval email, follow the instructions in the email to set your AWS Educate Student Portal password, and then sign in to your AWS Educate Student Portal\. After you set your AWS Educate Student Portal password, store that password in a secure location\.

1. The approval email contains information about AWS promotional credit that you can apply to your AWS account\. AWS promotional credit can help offset the cost of using qualifying AWS services, some of which can be used by or with AWS Cloud9\. To apply AWS promotional credit to your AWS account, do the following:

   1. With your AWS Educate Student Portal already open, choose **Sign In to the Console**\.
**Note**  
To return to your AWS Educate Student Portal, go to the AWS Educate Site Login website, at [https://www\.awseducate\.com/signin/](https://www.awseducate.com/signin/)\. Enter the email address and password that you used when you initially signed in to your AWS Educate Student Portal, and then choose **Sign In**\.

   1. Enter the email address for your AWS account, and then choose **Next**\.
**Note**  
If an email address is already displayed and it's the wrong one, choose **Sign in to a different account**\. Enter the correct email address, and then choose **Next**\.

   1. Enter the password for your AWS account, and then choose **Sign in**\.
**Important**  
Type the password for your AWS account, not your AWS Educate Student Portal password\.

   1. In the AWS navigation bar, choose your email address or display name, and then choose **My Account**\.

   1. Choose **Credits**\.

   1. For **Promo Code**, enter the **Credit Code** from the approval email\.

   1. Complete the **Security Check**, and then choose **Redeem**\.

   1. To see the list of AWS services that qualify for this credit, choose **See complete list**\.
**Note**  
AWS Cloud9 is not in this list of qualifying AWS services, because there is no additional charge for AWS Cloud9\. Instead, AWS automatically applies this credit toward qualifying AWS service usage, some of which can be used by or with AWS Cloud9\. For more information, see [AWS Cloud9 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/pricing/)\.

## Step 2: Sign In to the AWS Cloud9 Console<a name="setup-student-sign-in-ide"></a>

You're now ready to use either an [AWS Educate Starter Account](#setup-student-sign-in-ide-starter) or a [regular AWS account](#setup-student-sign-in-ide-regular) to sign in to the AWS Cloud9 console and start using AWS Cloud9\.
+  [Use an AWS Educate Starter Account to Sign In to the AWS Cloud9 Console](#setup-student-sign-in-ide-starter) 
+  [Use a Regular AWS Account to Sign In to the AWS Cloud9 Console](#setup-student-sign-in-ide-regular) 

### Use an AWS Educate Starter Account to Sign In to the AWS Cloud9 Console<a name="setup-student-sign-in-ide-starter"></a>

1. Go to the AWS Educate Site Login website, at [https://www\.awseducate\.com/signin/](https://www.awseducate.com/signin/)\.

1. Enter the email address and password that you use to sign in to your AWS Educate Student Portal, and then choose **Sign In**\.

1. Choose **AWS Account**\.

1. Choose **Go to your AWS Educate Starter Account**\.

1. Choose **AWS Console**\.

1. Do one of the following:
   + Choose **Cloud9**, if it's already displayed\.
   + Expand **All services**, and then choose **Cloud9**\.
   + In the **Find services** box, type **Cloud9**, and then press **Enter**\.
   + In the AWS navigation bar, choose **Services**, and then choose **Cloud9**\.

You can now start using AWS Cloud9\. Skip ahead to [Next Steps](#setup-student-next-steps)\.

### Use a Regular AWS Account to Sign In to the AWS Cloud9 Console<a name="setup-student-sign-in-ide-regular"></a>

1. Do one of the following:
   + Open the AWS Cloud9 console, at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloud9/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/)\.
   + Go to the AWS Educate Member Login website, at [https://aws\.amazon\.com/education/awseducate/members/](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/members/), and then choose **Sign In to the Console**\. \(Do not choose **Students Login Here**\.\)

1. Enter the email address for your AWS account, and then choose **Next**\.
**Note**  
If an email address is already displayed and it's the wrong one, choose **Sign in to a different account**\. Enter the correct email address, and then choose **Next**\.

1. Enter the password for your AWS account, and then choose **Sign in**\.
**Important**  
Enter the password for your AWS account, not your AWS Educate Student Portal password\.

1. If the AWS Management Console is displayed instead of the AWS Cloud9 console, do one of the following:
   + Choose **Cloud9**, if it's already displayed\.
   + Expand **All services**, and then choose **Cloud9**\.
   + In the **Find services** box, type **Cloud9**, and then press **Enter**\.
   + In the AWS navigation bar, choose **Services**, and then choose **Cloud9**\.

You can now start using AWS Cloud9\.

**Important**  
Although you can sign in to the AWS Cloud9 console with the email address and password that you used when you created your AWS account \(we call this an AWS account *root user*\), this isn't an AWS security best practice\. In the future, we recommend that you sign in to the AWS Cloud9 console as an administrator user in AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) in your AWS account instead\. For more information, see [Creating Your First IAM Admin User and Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html) in the *IAM User Guide* and [AWS Tasks That Require AWS Account Root User Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tasks-that-require-root.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.
